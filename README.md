## A Comprehensive Approach to Cybersecurity Testing Prioritization

### Introduction

In an increasingly complex digital landscape, organizations are faced with the challenge of managing vast amounts of data while protecting it from malicious actors. Cybersecurity has become a critical area of concern, with automated scanners providing an essential layer of defense by identifying vulnerabilities and potential risks. However, the sheer volume of findings generated by these scanners can overwhelm security teams, creating "noise" that obscures the most critical issues. To address this, a structured approach to cybersecurity testing prioritization is necessary.

This project introduces a comprehensive standard for cybersecurity testing prioritization, segmented into three key tiers:

1. **[Tier 1: Critical Threat Management](tiers/tier-1-critical-threat-management.md)**
   Focuses on the most pressing vulnerabilities that pose significant risks to an organization's security. These include critical vulnerabilities that, if exploited, could lead to severe data breaches, financial loss, or operational disruption.

2. **[Tier 2: Regulatory](tiers/tier-2-regulatory.md)**
   Addresses vulnerabilities that could result in non-compliance with legal or industry standards. These issues are crucial to maintain certifications, avoid penalties, and ensure the organization's ability to operate in regulated environments.

3. **[Tier 3: Best Practices](tiers/tier-3-best-practices.md)**
   Encompasses important security improvements that, while not immediately critical, are vital for strengthening the overall security posture and preventing future exploits.

By leveraging a combination of automated security scanners and frameworks like [OWASP](https://owasp.org/) and [MITRE](https://attack.mitre.org/)[^1], this standard aims to reduce noise and focus on the most pressing vulnerabilities, enhancing the overall security posture of organizations.
