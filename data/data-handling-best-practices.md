# Data Handling Best Practices

## Objective
Ensure that sensitive information is properly protected throughout its lifecycle, including encryption, access control, and data integrity.

### Tools
- **[Cloudsploit](https://cloudsploit.com/)**: Assesses data handling practices within cloud environments[^1].
- **[Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus)**: Identifies areas where data handling practices could be improved, such as encryption, access controls, and backup procedures[^1].

### Qualifying Tests
Scans should evaluate how data is handled, ensuring that best practices for encryption, access control, and data integrity are followed. Any gaps in these practices should be flagged for improvement.
