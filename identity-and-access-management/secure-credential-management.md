# Secure Credential Management

## Objective
Ensure that access keys, passwords, and other credentials are securely managed, rotated, and stored.

### Tools
- **[Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus)**: Audits credential management practices[^1].
- **[PROWLER](https://prowler.cloud/)**: Identifies weak credential management practices within cloud environments[^1].

### Qualifying Tests
Automated tests should assess the security of credential storage, rotation policies, and the use of secure methods for managing credentials. Weak or outdated practices should be flagged for improvement.
