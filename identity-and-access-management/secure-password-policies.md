# Secure Password and Access Key Policies

## Objective
Ensure that password complexity, rotation policies, and the security of access keys meet industry standards.

### Tools
- **[Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus)**: Audits password policies and the security of access keys[^1].
- **[PROWLER](https://prowler.cloud/)**: Detects weak password policies and insecure access keys within cloud environments[^1].

### Qualifying Tests
Scans should evaluate password complexity, rotation policies, and the security of access keys. Weak or default passwords and unrotated keys should be treated as critical issues.
