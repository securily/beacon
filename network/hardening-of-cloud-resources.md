# Hardening of Cloud Resources

## Objective
Identify areas where cloud resources can be further secured by applying industry best practices.

### Tools
- **[Cloudsploit](https://cloudsploit.com/)**: Detects areas where cloud resources could be further hardened[^1].
- **[PROWLER](https://prowler.cloud/)**: Assesses cloud resources against best practices for configuration and security[^1].

### Qualifying Tests
Scans should identify opportunities for hardening cloud resources, such as improving configuration settings or applying additional security controls.
