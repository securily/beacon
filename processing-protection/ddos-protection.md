# DDoS Protection

## Objective
Ensure that DDoS protection measures are in place and correctly configured to safeguard systems against attacks.

### Tools
- **[Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus)**: Assesses the presence of DDoS protection mechanisms[^1].
- **[PROWLER](https://prowler.cloud/)**: Identifies DDoS protection configurations within cloud environments[^1].

### Qualifying Tests
Automated scans should verify that DDoS protection measures are in place and correctly configured. The absence of such measures should be treated as a critical issue.

[^1]: For details on all scanners and frameworks used, see [Scanners and Frameworks](../scanners-and-frameworks.md).
