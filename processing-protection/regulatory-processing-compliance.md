# Regulatory Processing Compliance

## Objective
Ensure that processing resources meet the standards required by regulations, particularly in sensitive industries.

### Tools
- **[Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus)**: Assesses processing resources for compliance with regulatory standards[^1].
- **[PROWLER](https://prowler.cloud/)**: Identifies compliance issues within cloud processing configurations[^1].

### Qualifying Tests
Scans should verify that processing resources comply with relevant regulations, including data localization, protection against unauthorized access, and monitoring requirements.
